# Autonomous Intelligence

[Autonomous Intelligence](https://privatechatbot.ai/) is an open source research project aimed at building collaborative multi-agent AI systems. The agentic framework provides a robust infrastructure for creating and managing multiple AI agents, and enables developers and organizations to build, deploy, and optimize AI agents that work well in dynamic, complex environments.

## Product Overview

### General Purpose Multi-Agent Framework
The framework provides a robust infrastructure for creating and managing multiple AI agents. It enables seamless collaboration between agents to tackle complex tasks, dynamically adapting to user inputs and changing conditions. Task execution is automated through dynamic selection of the best agents, tools, and workflows for the job. The system handles dependencies, monitors progress, and troubleshoots issues in real time.

### User Interaction
Users can design and visualize workflows using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface or directly interact with agents through conversational natural language queries.

### SDK and API Access
Developers can leverage tools for integrating AI agent functionality into their applications. The platform supports customization and modular development for scalability and efficiency.

## How It Works

Autonomous Intelligence's architecture is built around a decentralized network of specialized agents that work both independently and collaboratively. These agents communicate through defined pathways, managed by an orchestrator that ensures tasks are distributed and executed efficiently.

### Core Components

| Component                    | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestrator**             | Central hub for task assignment, execution, and monitoring. Manages agent interactions and refines workflows dynamically. |
| **Agent**                    | An autonomous unit programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents. |
| **Task**                     | A specific assignment completed by an agent, providing all necessary details like description, tools, and responsibilities. |
| **Crew**                     | A collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Crews define strategies for task execution and agent collaboration. |
| **Process Implementations**  | Frameworks for agent collaboration. This includes sequential tasks that are executed in an orderly progression, or hierarchical tasks are managed via a structured chain of command|
| **Large Language Models (LLMs)** | Backbone of intelligent agents, enabling capabilities like natural language understanding and reasoning. Includes models like GPT, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, and Llama that are Optimized for complex workflows. |
| **Tool**                     | A skill or function agents use to perform actions, that includes capabilities like search, computer use, data extraction, file uploading and advanced interactions. |
| **Agent Registry**           | A structured catalog organizing agents by domain, task type, and functionality, allowing users to deploy agents seamlessly. |
| **Frontend Interface**       | Drag-and-drop visual workflow builder and real-time dashboards for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing agent performance. |

## Workflow Example

1. **Input Query**: The user provides a task, e.g., “Reach out to a list of 10,000 New York-based heads of AI who work in mid-sized finance companies.”
2. **Data Collection**: The orchestrator leverages an AI-powered data foundation and the web to source the most reliable leads. The agent processes the input criteria to generate a list, such as Job Title: Data Scientist, Industry: Technology, Company Size: >1,000, Location: United States
3. **Agent Workflow**: The AI workflow processes the input by applying specific rules and guidelines to filter the data. Agents collaborate to refine the lead list and create tailored email drafts for each contact.
4. **Email and List Generation**: The system outputs a curated list of leads, including contact information, along with tailored email content ready for automated delivery.
5. **Automation**: Emails are automatically sent to the generated list of leads. The system tracks progress, showing the number of emails sent and responses received daily.
6. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback is incorporated to improve the lead generation process, refine email drafts, or adjust selection criteria for future tasks.
