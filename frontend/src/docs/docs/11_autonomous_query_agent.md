# Autonomous Query Agent

## **Overview**

The **Autonomous Query Agent** exemplifies Panacea's advanced capabilities by autonomously determining optimal queries based on the surrounding environment and predefined reward mechanisms. This agent operates independently, identifying tasks that maximize rewards and executing them without explicit user instructions. This level of autonomy enhances efficiency, adaptability, and intelligent decision-making within the Panacea ecosystem.

## **Scenario**

**Objective:** Enable Panacea to proactively identify and execute tasks that align with user-defined goals and environmental factors, optimizing outcomes through autonomous query generation and execution.

**User Intent:** While the user may not provide direct instructions, they set up the environment and define rewards that guide the AI's autonomous behavior.

## **Workflow Breakdown**

1. **Environment Setup and Reward Definition:**
   - **User Configuration:**
     - Defines the operational environment parameters (e.g., available resources, data sources).
     - Establishes reward mechanisms that prioritize certain outcomes over others (e.g., efficiency, accuracy, cost-effectiveness).

2. **Orchestrator's Role in Autonomous Operation:**
   - **Task Identification:**
     - Continuously monitors the environment and evaluates potential opportunities or challenges.
     - Uses the defined rewards to assess which tasks to prioritize and execute.
   - **Query Generation:**
     - Formulates natural language queries that align with the highest-reward tasks.
     - Ensures queries are contextually relevant and optimized for desired outcomes.

3. **Agent Collaboration and Execution:**

   ### **Step 1: Environment Monitoring**
   - **Monitoring Agent:**
     - Continuously scans the environment for changes, new data, or emerging trends.
     - Identifies gaps, opportunities, or areas needing attention based on user-defined parameters.

   ### **Step 2: Task Evaluation and Reward Assessment**
   - **Evaluation Agent:**
     - Analyzes identified opportunities against the reward criteria.
     - Determines the potential rewards and impacts of executing specific tasks.
     - Prioritizes tasks that offer the highest rewards.

   ### **Step 3: Query Formulation**
   - **Query Generator Agent:**
     - Constructs precise and effective natural language queries tailored to the prioritized tasks.
     - Ensures queries are actionable and provide clear directives to other agents.

   ### **Step 4: Task Execution**
   - **Task-Specific Agents:**
     - **Web Surfer Agent:** Executes web searches to gather necessary information or resources.
     - **Autocode Agent:** Develops or modifies code to address identified needs.
     - **Data Analyst Agent:** Processes and analyzes data to inform decision-making.
     - **Emailer Agent:** Communicates with stakeholders or external parties as required.

   ### **Step 5: Outcome Evaluation and Iteration**
   - **Feedback Agent:**
     - Assesses the outcomes of executed tasks against the defined rewards.
     - Provides feedback to the orchestrator for continuous improvement.
   - **Orchestrator:**
     - Adjusts future task prioritization and query formulations based on feedback.
     - Enhances the agent's decision-making algorithms to better align with user goals.

## **Detailed Interaction Flow**

### **Step 1: Initial Environment Setup**

- **User:** Configures Panacea by defining the operational environment and setting up reward criteria.
  - **Example Configuration:**
    ```yaml
    environment:
      data_sources:
        - internal_database
        - public_api
      available_resources:
        - CPU: 8 cores
        - Memory: 16GB
        - Storage: 100GB SSD

    rewards:
      efficiency: 0.4
      accuracy: 0.3
      cost_effectiveness: 0.3
    ```

### **Step 2: Autonomous Monitoring and Evaluation**

- **Monitoring Agent:** Continuously scans the environment for new data or changes.
  - **Detected Change:** New data available from a public API related to market trends.

- **Evaluation Agent:** Assesses the potential tasks that can be performed with the new data.
  - **Task 1:** Analyze market trends to identify investment opportunities.
    - **Reward Calculation:**
      - Efficiency: High
      - Accuracy: Medium
      - Cost-Effectiveness: High

### **Step 3: Query Generation and Task Assignment**

- **Query Generator Agent:** Formulates a natural language query based on Task 1.
  - **Generated Query:**
    ```
    Analyze the latest market trends from the public API to identify top investment opportunities for Q3 2024.
    ```

- **Orchestrator:** Assigns the query to the relevant agents for execution.

### **Step 4: Task Execution by Agents**

- **Web Surfer Agent:** Fetches the latest market data from the public API.

- **Data Analyst Agent:** Processes and analyzes the fetched data to identify investment opportunities.

- **Autocode Agent:** Develops a report summarizing the findings.

- **Emailer Agent:** Sends the report to the user for review.

### **Step 5: Outcome Evaluation and Iteration**

- **Feedback Agent:** Evaluates the report's usefulness and accuracy based on user feedback.
  - **User Feedback:** "The report is accurate but could benefit from more detailed analysis on emerging markets."

- **Orchestrator:** Adjusts future task prioritization to place greater emphasis on detailed analysis.

- **Query Generator Agent:** Formulates a new query to address the feedback.
  - **New Query:**
    ```
    Provide a detailed analysis of emerging markets within the latest market trends data to identify potential high-growth investment opportunities.
    ```

- **Cycle Continues:** The autonomous system iterates to refine tasks and improve outcomes based on ongoing feedback.

## **Benefits**

- **Proactive Operation:** Enables Panacea to anticipate and address needs without explicit user instructions.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Iteratively enhances task execution based on feedback and performance metrics.
- **Optimized Decision-Making:** Aligns task prioritization with user-defined rewards to maximize desired outcomes.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Utilizes available resources effectively by autonomously managing task allocation and execution.
- **Scalability:** Adapts to varying environments and complex scenarios, making it suitable for diverse applications.
