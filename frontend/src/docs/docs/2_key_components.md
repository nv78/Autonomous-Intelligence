# Core Components

Our agentic AI framework comprises of several core components:

| Component                    | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestrator**             | Central hub for task assignment, execution, and monitoring. Manages agent interactions and refines workflows dynamically. |
| **Agent**                    | An autonomous unit programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents. |
| **Task**                     | A specific assignment completed by an agent, providing all necessary details like description, tools, and responsibilities. |
| **Crew**                     | A collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Crews define strategies for task execution and agent collaboration. |
| **Process Implementations**  | Frameworks for agent collaboration. This includes sequential tasks that are executed in an orderly progression, or hierarchical tasks are managed via a structured chain of command|
| **Large Language Models (LLMs)** | Backbone of intelligent agents, enabling capabilities like natural language understanding and reasoning. Includes models like GPT, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, and Llama that are Optimized for complex workflows. |
| **Tool**                     | A skill or function agents use to perform actions, that includes capabilities like search, computer use, data extraction, file uploading and advanced interactions. |
| **Agent Registry**           | A structured catalog organizing agents by domain, task type, and functionality, allowing users to deploy agents seamlessly. |
| **Frontend Interface**       | Drag-and-drop visual workflow builder and real-time dashboards for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing agent performance. |
