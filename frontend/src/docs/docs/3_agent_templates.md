## Custom Agents

In addition to predefined agents, we allow users to create custom agents tailored to specific needs. This flexibility ensures that Panacea can adapt to a wide range of tasks and industries.

### Creating a Custom Agent

1. **Define the Agent's Purpose**: Determine the specific task or function the agent will perform.
2. **Configure Capabilities**: Set up the tools and resources the agent will require.
3. **Set Communication Protocols**: Define how the agent will interact with other agents and the orchestrator.
4. **Deploy the Agent**: Launch the agent within the Panacea environment, ready to execute tasks.
