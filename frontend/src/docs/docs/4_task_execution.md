# Task Execution

Tasks are the fundamental units of work within Panacea. Each task is a specific instruction that an agent needs to execute. Tasks can be handled in series or in parallel, depending on their nature and dependencies.

## Execution Modes

- **Sequential Execution**: Tasks are executed one after another, suitable for dependent tasks where the output of one task is required for the next.
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks are executed simultaneously, ideal for independent tasks that can be processed concurrently to save time.

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Tasks are created based on user queries or predefined workflows.
2. **Assignment**: The orchestrator assigns tasks to the appropriate agents.
3. **Execution**: Agents execute the tasks within their environments.
4. **Completion**: Upon successful execution, results are returned and logged.
5. **Monitoring**: Ongoing tracking ensures tasks are completed as expected.

## Task Management Features

- **Priority Levels**: Assign priorities to tasks to manage execution order effectively.
- **Dependency Handling**: Manage task dependencies to ensure proper execution flow.
- **Error Handling**: Implement mechanisms to handle task failures gracefully, including retries and fallbacks.
