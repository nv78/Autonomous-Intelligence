# Agent Creation

Users can create and customize their own agents through the UI, tailoring them to specific tasks and workflows. This flexibility allows for the creation of a personalized swarm of agents that work together to handle complex processes.

## Agent Creation Steps

1. **Select Agent Type**: Choose from predefined agent types or define a custom agent based on specific needs.
2. **Configure Agent Settings**: Set up agent-specific configurations, such as task parameters and resource allocations.
3. **Define Workflow**: Specify how the agent interacts with other agents and the orchestrator within workflows.
4. **Deploy Agent**: Launch the agent within the desired environment, making it ready to execute tasks.

## Customization Options

- **Task Specialization**: Assign specific tasks or functions to each agent, ensuring they operate within their expertise.
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate appropriate computational resources (CPU, memory, storage) to each agent to optimize performance.
- **Integration Settings**: Configure how agents integrate with external systems or APIs, enabling seamless data flow and functionality expansion.
- **Security Settings**: Define access controls and permissions to safeguard data and operations within each agent's environment.
