# Agents

An **Agent** is an autonomous unit designed to perform tasks, make decisions, and possibly interact with other Agents. Agents can be specialized by role or configured for different goals.

## 1. Defining an Agent

```python
from anote_agents import Agent

customer_support_agent = Agent(
    role="Customer Support Agent",
    goal="Assist users with common troubleshooting steps",
    tools=[],
    verbose=True,
    backstory="You are friendly and patient, helping customers find solutions."
)
```
Parameters
role (str): Descriptive title or function (e.g., "Venue Coordinator").
goal (str): The primary objective (e.g., "Book a venue that fits the budget").
tools (list): Optional list of tool instances the Agent can leverage.
verbose (bool): If True, logs additional debug info.
backstory (str): Optional narrative about the Agentâ€™s personality or expertise.
2. Agent Behaviors
Agents can:

Autonomously execute tasks
Leverage Tools to gather information or take actions
Collaborate with other agents within a Crew
3. Advanced Customization
instructions (list): Additional guidance for the Agent (e.g., formatting rules).
model: If using advanced LLM integrations, specify a particular model or language engine.
By defining Agents carefully, you ensure they remain focused on their intended purpose and handle tasks efficiently.
