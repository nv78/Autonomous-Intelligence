# Overview

The Private Chatbot API is a software developer kit designed for developers to leverage Private LLMs to upload documents, chat with them and evaluate the answers. There are 3 API endpoints:

- Upload: Upload documents or specify a ticker for data retrieval and Q&A.

- Chat: Send a message to the chatbot based on documents previously uploaded.

- Evaluate: Evaluate predictions on one or multiple documents/text.

If you are a first time user looking to get started, navigate to setup.md, if you are looking for applications of the technology navigate to capabilities or see our Private Chatbot developer cookbook.
