            Access to New Data Sources - Really, our value add is that there is
            an entire universe of data that exists, that is unable to
            successfully be used in AI/ML projects. The only way to access this
            data currently is via manual labeling, which doesn't cost
            effectively scale to most of these relevant use cases. From our
            novel data annotation interface, we are able to provide access to
            high quality labeled data sources that otherwise would have been too
            poor of quality to use. On our product, users not only get access to
            these new data sources, but can also create these "proprietary novel
            datasets" that are customizable to their use case, and can modify
            them to fit their domain specific task. In other words, there's this
            endless gold mine of data out there, and the technology has just
            become ripe enough to excavate this data.

            Designed for Data Labelers - We designed our product for the end
            user in mind - data labelers. Anote's goal is to make the data
            labeling process as easy, seamless and enjoyable as possible for
            data labelers. To do this, we asked data labelers to go through each
            of the competitive products, and write down a comprehensive list of
            things they liked and did not like, that way we could incorporate
            the items that they value into our product.

            AI focused approach - Anote's perspective is that companies
            prioritizing AI assisted annotations where users don't need to
            manually annotate all data points, but can still get insights, have
            a better chance to win in the market, rather then companies
            prioritizing manual annotations. Manually labeling data is tedious,
            time consuming (takes months to years), expensive (companies pay
            millions of dollars for this) and not entirely accurate. AI and new
            technology is bound to disrupt the data labeling industry.

            Tackling Unsolvable Domains - While the data annotation space is
            "relatively crowded" - the capabilities of existing AI assisted
            annotation tools is for text data is limited. Many of the tasks
            related to unstructured text data simply can not be done with
            existing tools, as most of the focus in the data annotation space
            has been around image data and autonomous vehicles. This means that
            for the majority of text data, these AI projects fail due to a lack
            of labeled training data. Existing tools don't solve most problems,
            leaving a huge untapped market.

            Focus on Text Data - While many competitors are expanding towards
            many domains and data types, we focus solely on text data, as it has
            more upside than image, video, audio, and lidar, from both volume
            and ROI. Text data is more than 85% of the data in businesses, and
            consists of over 35% of ROI in the data labeling space, larger than
            image and audio data.

            Humans in the Loop vs. Strictly AI Philosophy - Humans will be kept
            in the loop. Specifically, subject matter experts will provide the
            ontology to models via heuristic programmatic labeling functions.
            Data labelers will still be needed to label some data - just much
            less data than previously.

            Best Features of Existing Products - We like certain aspects of
            existing solutions, and have incorporated the best features into our
            product. We like Snorkel's heuristic programmatic labeling
            capabilities, and the fact that it has saved a lot of time and money
            for many real world use cases. We like Prodigy’s GUI, and the user
            experience it provides. We think that Prodigy makes the data
            labeling experience more enjoyable. We like Datasaur’s advanced NLP
            capabilities, such as coreference resolution, dependency parsing,
            aspect-based sentiment analysis, and full word heuristic matching.

            Contrarian Perspective - What we are doing is unconventional, as
            others are interested in: LLM's with Many Parameters, Synthetic Data
            Generation, Zero Shot Learning, and Prompt Engineering. What others
            don't realize is that Transformers are changing everything, Seq2Seq
            Encoder models are powerful, and can be encoded in these LLMs. The
            NLP LLM race isn't to more parameters, but rather to performing
            causal learning from fewer parameters / more lightweight models. You
            still need labeled training data, just way less than you needed
            before

            The Engine for AI - Defensibility in this space will be from the
            advent of a global "AI Engine." Our global model continuously learns
            from the local model. This leads to better, faster, more robust and
            personalized results for the individual user as well as smarter and
            more generalizable global models for Anote. This directly translates
            to less time / money spent labeling data, and higher quality labeled
            data as an output. The more users provide data annotations to our
            app The better the global model initializations become The less time
            it takes users to obtain better predictions

              Lightweight Few Shot Learning Models - Lightweight few shot
              learning transformer models will triumph over many parameter
              "Decoder" LLMs. The reason being is that smaller models provide
              state of the art performance on few shot learning tasks, are more
              lightweight than other Large Language Models, which leads to
              faster run times and practical model distillation. We particularly
              like the AlexaTM model, the Setfit model, and Bidirectional
              Seq2Seq Encoder / Decoder models. Innovations with few shot
              learning have enabled many of these tasks that "can't be done" to
              now be possible in the past year and practical in the past few
              months. These new advancements are happening now, and the first to
              the space has a tremendous advantage. The time is now to build

            Active Learning - We actively learn from each data annotation on the
            GUI, via novel few shot learning innovations from transformer based
            architectures. Every time a user manually annotates, both our global
            and local model are actively improving, leading to better and faster
            results. We sort items in Table By a mixture of most uncertainty
            (Lowest Probability) and entropy (Highest Volatility) to ensure the
            user does the least amount of annotations possible.
